Creating my first website
Goal: 
      showcase portfolio 
      potentially grounds for future ventures
Ideas: 
      Using a cityscape(drawn or photographed) through a window as buttons for different avenues of thought
      Real time text update that I can edit on github to push when requested, ideally people can text in questions as well
